  },
  "product_overview": "The Visual Life Execution System is a SaaS platform that transforms user effort into evolving visual art representing multi-domain life visions. It integrates AI coaching, adaptive daily loops, and narrative-driven introspection to help users visualize, track, and evolve their life goals through progressive pixelated vision boards and an interactive timeline experience.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable users to define and manage multi-domain life visions and goals.",
    "Provide AI-assisted goal decomposition and coaching for actionable planning.",
    "Visualize user progress as evolving pixelated vision boards that transform from grayscale to colorful art.",
    "Support adaptive daily routines with journal reflections and task validations to maintain engagement.",
    "Allow goal mutation without data loss to preserve user progress and maintain visual continuity.",
    "Generate periodic narrative wraps and animations summarizing user journeys.",
    "Offer customizable design styles and export options for sharing and personal reflection.",
    "Ensure privacy, security, and scalability using modern authentication, storage, and background job systems."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Authentication system with secure user registration, login, and JWT session management.",
    "Multi-step onboarding for vision definition, domain setup with image uploads, design style selection, and goal decomposition.",
    "Dynamic dashboard displaying vision boards, progress tracking, journal panel, tasks, and domain management.",
    "Progressive pixelation system mapping user effort into colored pixels on domain-specific vision boards.",
    "Journal system capturing daily reflections linked to task completion with AI-driven emotional and energy analysis.",
    "Task management with AI-generated task suggestions, validation, adjustment, and completion tracking.",
    "Timeline and weekly wrap features with AI-generated narratives and animated video summarization.",
    "Multiple board design styles (grid, collage, cinematic, minimalist, symmetric) with user selection ability.",
    "Reminder system for bedtime journal entries and morning task validations with push notifications.",
    "Goal mutation capabilities that archive old goals, lock progress, and create new goals preserving historical context.",
    "Export functionalities for wallpapers (mobile/desktop) and journey videos with shareable links.",
    "Global state management with React Query and Zustand, with performant frontend using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.",
    "Robust backend services using Node.js/TypeScript with PostgreSQL, Redis, S3-compatible storage, and background job queues.",
    "AI integration leveraging Claude and OpenAI APIs for coaching, reflection interpretation, task and goal decomposition, and story generation."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Onboarding Flow: Users define life vision, set up domains with inspirational images, select preferred vision board design, and approve AI-decomposed goals with milestones and tasks.",
    "Daily Loop: Evening bedtime reminders prompt journaling with task completion. AI reflection interprets entries driving pixel updates and next-day task generation. Morning reminders present user tasks for acceptance, adjustment, or skipping.",
    "Goal Change Flow: Users can change goals without resetting progress, archiving old goals while locking pixel progress and initiating new goals with transition narratives preserving visual continuity.",
    "Weekly Wrap Generation: Automated aggregation of weekly user journals and pixel progress to create narrative summaries and animations accessible via timeline view and notifications.",
    "Vision Board Interaction: Users view and interact with progressively colorized boards reflecting their effort across domains with real-time visual feedback and milestone celebrations.",
    "Timeline Exploration: Horizontal navigation through daily, weekly, monthly snapshots with story overlays and ability to export visual journeys.",
    "Task Management: Validation and approval of AI-suggested tasks with inline chat for adjustments to maintain engagement and personalized planning.",
    "Reminder Configuration: Users customize notification times for journaling and task validation aligned with personal routines."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users must successfully register, authenticate, and maintain sessions using JWT with token refresh.",
    "Onboarding completes with domains, images uploaded correctly, and AI-decomposed goals approved by the user.",
    "Vision boards generate accurately in selected design style showing correct grayscale and color pixel mapping by domain.",
    "Journal entries are submitted once per day with task completion accurately recorded and pixels awarded accordingly.",
    "AI-generated reflections extract emotional state and energy level consistently and drive appropriate pixel and task updates.",
    "Morning tasks are generated, displayed, and modifiable by users, correctly reflecting task approval status.",
    "Goal mutations archive old goals, lock pixel histories, create new goals, and visualize transition narratives without data loss.",
    "Weekly wrap animations generate timely with smooth pixel progression and narrative text matching user activity.",
    "Reminders send as scheduled respecting user-configured times and timezones, with no duplicate notifications per day.",
    "Exported wallpapers and videos are generated in specified resolutions with valid download URLs.",
    "Frontend components render consistently across devices with responsive layouts and smooth animations.",
    "Backend APIs respond correctly with proper authorization, error handling, and data integrity.",
    "AI responses are validated against expected schema and fallback mechanisms ensure reliability.",
    "Image uploads and storage are secure with proper access controls and signed URLs.",
    "Background jobs execute scheduled tasks for reminders, board generation, pixel spillover, and timeline stitching reliably."

[WARNING] [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. (at webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/next/dist/client/dev/hot-reloader/app/hot-reloader-app.js:111:24)

#### Test TC015 Dashboard Responsive Layout Rendering
- **Test Code:** [TC015_Dashboard_Responsive_Layout_Rendering.py](./TC015_Dashboard_Responsive_Layout_Rendering.py)

The CONTINUE MISSION button transitions correctly to the main dashboard view without layout shifts or jank. However, testing on tablet and mobile screen sizes is still pending, so full confirmation of responsiveness and animation smoothness across all device sizes is incomplete.
